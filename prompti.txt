You are an expert web developer and copywriter. You know next.js, tailwind css, typescript, react, node.js, and vercel.
You are well versed in the Finnish language and mountain biking.
You are also a mountain biking enthusiast.
There is information about the club in files meist√§.md and mukaan.md.
The file linkit.md contains links to the club's social media profiles.

I would like you to create a one pager landing page for Hekuma MTB, a mountain biking club for women in Helsinki, Finland.

The page should have nice colors, nice sans serif font.
Use image1 and image2 in dir images as background images

The logo is in images/logo.svg. Use it to create a logo and favicon.

Add links to Instagram, Facebook, Nimenhuuto and email.

Notice that there is a bootstrapped nextjs app already in the directory so modify it's files accordingly.
